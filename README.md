# Entail Frontend Challenge

A React + TypeScript implementation of the Entail Senior Frontend Engineer case study.

The app displays:
- A **timeline** of planned offshore tasks
- A **Selected Task** panel with task details
- **Weather forecast** chart (wave height & period)
- **Go/No-Go** indicator based on weather limits
- Static **3D placeholders** for vessel/platform/riser views

Built with strict typing (no `any`, no `null`), accessible components, error handling, and automated tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or newer
